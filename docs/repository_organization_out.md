# Repository Organization

This repository contains two independent components:
1. **dnacalib C++ library** - used to manipulate DNA files
2. **dna_viewer python code** - used to visualize DNA in Autodesk Maya

# Folder structure

- [dnacalib](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/dnacalib) - DNACalib source code
- [dna_viewer](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/dna_viewer) - source code of dna_viewer
- [examples](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/examples) - several Python scripts to show basic usage of dna_viewer and the Python wrapper for DNACalib
- [lib](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/lib) - pre-built binaries for DNACalib, PyDNACalib, and PyDNA
- [data](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/data) - required DNAs and Maya scenes
- [docs](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/docs) - documentation


## DNACalib
Documentation is located [here](dnacalib_md)

## DNAViewer
Documentation is located [here](dna_viewer_md)

## Examples
To run [DNAViewer examples](/dna_viewer_md#examples), you must have Maya 2022 installed.
To run [DNACalib examples](/dnacalib_md#python), you need Python3.

## Lib

[Lib folder](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/lib) contains pre-built binaries of the DNACalib library for Windows and Linux. Additionally, a Maya plugin for
RL4 is also available.

### Linux location
You have to copy or create symbolic links for all **.so** files in [lib](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/lib/Maya2022/linux):

```shell
sudo ln -s ~/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/lib/Maya2022/linux/_py3dna.so /usr/lib/_py3dna.so

sudo ln -s ~/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/lib/Maya2022/linux/libdnacalib.so /usr/lib/libdnacalib.so

sudo ln -s ~/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/lib/Maya2022/linux/libdnacalib.so.6 /usr/lib/libdnacalib.so.6

sudo ln -s ~/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/lib/Maya2022/linux/libembeddedRL4.so /usr/lib/embeddedRL4.mll

sudo ln -s ~/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/lib/Maya2022/linux/MayaUERBFPlugin.mll /usr/lib/MayaUERBFPlugin.mll
```

Note: Change the path `~/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration` to where `MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration` is located.

## Data

The [`data folder`](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/data) contains example DNA files. We provided two MetaHuman DNA files (Ada and Taro, our first Presets).

| Ada | Taro |

Additionally, we added [`gui`](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/data/gui.ma) and [`analog_gui`](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/data/analog_gui.ma) Maya scenes which are used during
Maya scene assemble.
Furthermore, [`additional_assemble_script.py`](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/data/additional_assemble_script.py) is used to organize objects in scene and
connect controls. The ideal setup looks like this:

The MHC 2023 spring release introduced changes to the rig definition (number of joints increased as well as the number of expressions).
In order to accommodate those changes, we added several files to the repository in `/data/mh4` folder: new [gui scene](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/data/mh4/gui.ma), updated [assemble script](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/data/mh4/additional_assemble_script.py) and example of Adaâ€™s [DNA file](https://github.com/EpicGames/MetaHuman-DNA-Calibration/tree/main/data/mh4/dna_files/Ada.dna).
Furthermore, in lib folder we added Maya RBF plugin which is used for controlling neck expressions. Neck setup has recently been improved and adding RBF plugin as well as new gui scene to use it, we get better neck deformations.
